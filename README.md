# Hippocampus-Segmentation
Objective
The project aims to develop a segmentation model for automatically identifying and segmenting the hippocampus from 3D MRI brain images. The hippocampus is further divided into two regions: the hippocampal head and the hippocampal tail.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 3D MRI scans of the brain, focusing on the hippocampus region. 
Training Set: 200 cases
Testing Set: 60 cases

The project uses a 3D U-Net model, a convolutional neural network designed for volumetric image segmentation.
